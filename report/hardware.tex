\section{Hardware and software}
\label{sec:hardware}

For hardware we have used the following setup. We have used single 
machine as initiator. The machine had dual core Intel Celeron 
processor, $16$ GB of Random Access Memory (RAM) and $500$ GB
hard disk drive. The responder was less capable Raspberry PI 
microcontroller, but had quad core CPU each running at $1.0$ GHz, 
$1$ GB of RAM and a flash card for durable storage. For software 
we have used Ubuntu 18.04 on initiator, and Raspbian OS on the responder.

We have exposed our implmementation of the HIPv2 protocol in GitHub repository.
