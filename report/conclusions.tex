\section{Conclusions}
\label{section:conclusion}

In this short document we have discussed the implementation 
details of Host Identity Protocol (HIP), which as a layer $3.5$ 
security solution aiming at separation of dual role of an IP
address. HIP protocol not only solves the problem of separation
of roles of the IP addresses, but can also be a secure mobility
solution. There are many applications of HIP in modern networks -
from establishing a secure channel between stationary network
entities, to secure mobile users.

We have created a minimal Python-based implementation of HIP and 
experimented with it: (i) we have made several microbanchmarkings, and (ii)
we completed several rounds of stress tests of the solution (
basically, we have made several concurrent connections to HIP
server and measured duration of HIP base exchange). In this work the 
implementation of IPSec protocol was out of the scope.
