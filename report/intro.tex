Sometimes it is easier to implement prototypes in userspace 
using high-level languages, such as Python or Java. In this 
document we attempt to implement the Host Identity Protocol 
version 2 using Python language. In the first part, we describe
various security solutions, then we discuss some implementation
details of the HIP protocol, and finally, in the last part
of this work we discuss the performance of the HIP and IPSec 
protocols.
