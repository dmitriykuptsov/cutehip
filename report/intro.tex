\section{Introduction}
\label{section:introduction}

Sometimes it is easier to implement prototypes in userspace 
using high-level languages, such as Python or Java. In this 
document we attempt to describe our implementation effort 
related to Host Identity Protocol version 2. In the first 
part, we describe various security solutions, then we 
discuss some implementation details of the HIP protocol, 
and finally, in the last part of this work we discuss the 
performance of the HIP and IPSec protocols implemented using 
Python language.
